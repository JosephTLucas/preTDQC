# Exercise 1
1. Run the encoder with "python3 encoder.py" to understand what the script does.
2. Follow the notes in the comments to add your own function to the encoder.
Ref:  [first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)

# Exercise 2
1. Create your own python file that outputs the two potential inputs from the encoder (because of the miano function's floor division).  Your answer should be a formatted as (X, Y). file name: <last name>-decoder.py
2. Submit it as a pull request to the same repository.
Ref:  To begin introducing you to C, I wrote the decoder in C.  You can read my code in lucas-decoder.c (using vim) or execute it with "./lucas-decoder.o yournumber"
